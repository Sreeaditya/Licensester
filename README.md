# Licensester
Licensester is a web application developed using streamlit that detects the license plate of a vehicle using YoloV7 and reads the license plate using EasyOCR. The Dataset of the set of images of various vehicles is taken from Kaggle. The Application has three forms of input, we can either choose to upload an image, a video or use our live feed from a compatible webcam.
